# Quiz Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack Quiz Application built using **React** (with **Vite**) for the frontend and **Spring Boot** for the backend. The application allows users to:

- Create quizzes by selecting a subject and specifying the difficulty level.
- Manage quiz questions (create, update, delete).
- Take quizzes based on selected subjects and difficulty.
- View available subjects and difficulty levels.

The backend API interacts with a **MySQL** database to store and manage quiz data, including subjects, questions, and difficulty levels.

The `README.md` provides a comprehensive overview of your project, including instructions on how to set up both the frontend and backend, how to configure the MySQL database, and how to run the application.

It includes API documentation for managing quiz questions, subjects, and difficulty levels.

The technologies used section outlines the frameworks and tools you are using for both the frontend and backend.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend (React with Vite):

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A modern, fast build tool to enhance React development.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **React Router**: For managing navigation in the application.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling and responsive design.

### Backend (Spring Boot):

- **Spring Boot**: For building the backend REST API.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database interaction with MySQL.
- **Spring Security**: (Optional) For authentication and authorization if required.
- **MySQL**: Database for persisting quiz data.

### Database:

- **MySQL**: A relational database for storing quiz data (questions, subjects, difficulty levels).

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the backend folder.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd quiz-application-backend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using Maven.

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Configure the application.properties file to connect to your local MySQL database.

   ```bash
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/quiz_app
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=<your_password>
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   spring.jpa.show-sql=true
   ```

4. Run the Spring Boot application.
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

### Frontend Setup (React with Vite)

1. Navigate to the frontend folder.

   ```bash
   cd quiz-application-frontend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using npm.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using npm.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. The frontend will run on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173), and it will communicate with the backend API running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Database Setup (MySQL)

1. Install and run MySQL on your local machine.

2. Create a database for the quiz application
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE quiz_app;
   ```
3. The tables will be auto-generated by Spring Data JPA based on the entities defined in the backend.

### API Endpoints

### Questions

- **Get all questions**:  
  `GET /api/quizzes/get-all-questions`

- **Create a question**:  
  `POST /api/quizzes/create-new-question`  
  Request body:
  ```json
  {
    "question": "What is the square root of 81",
    "questionType": "single",
    "choices": ["A. 39", "B. 9", "C. 8", "D. 56"],
    "correctAnswers": ["B"],
    "subject": "Mathematics",
    "difficulty": "Easy"
  }
  ```
- **Update a question**:
  `PUT /api/quizzes/questions/{id}/update`
  Request body:

  ```json
  {
    "question": "What is the square root of 25?",
    "questionType": "single",
    "choices": ["A. 5", "B. 9", "C. 8", "D. 6"],
    "correctAnswers": ["B"],
    "subject": "Mathematics",
    "difficulty": "Easy"
  }
  ```

- **Delete a question**:
  `DELETE /api/quizzes/questions/{id}/delete`

### Subjects

- **Get all subjects**:
  `GET /api/quizzes/subject`

### Difficulty

- **Get all difficulties**:
  `GET /api/quizzes/difficulty`

### Running the Application

1. Ensure that your MySQL server is running, and the necessary database is created.

2. Start the backend server using the command:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
3. Start the frontend server using:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`, and the backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
